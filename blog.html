            <h2>This was my first commission work !</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
              On 16th of jan 2021 was the day when after using instagram for 3
              months to publish my artworks, I received my first ever commission
              work from Punjab. The image on the left is the artwork I am
              talking about. Initially I never thought of sharing my artworks to
              get paid work, but in a few days everything started multiplying. I
              started getting orders from various places in India.

            <h2>My first international work</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
              So 3 months after getting my first ever commission work, I got the
              opportunity to work for an international client from London.
              Initially I was just supposed to make my client’s artwork and send
              her the softcopy of the artwork and short recorded video
              (time-lapse) of the whole process. But she loved the artwork so
              much that she accepted to pay for very expensive shipping too just
              to get that artwork. Delivery charges were more than the cost of
              the artwork.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              This artwork taught me alot. I learned many new skills like video
              editing, how international payments cannot be received directly
              into your Indian bank account and how to send a parcel to another
              country very cheap by exploring many shipping options of different
              shipping agencies. This artwork prepared me for many future
              opportunities which were about to unfold.

            <h2>I designed a Garbage Pail kids card</h2>

            <p>
              A very unique opportunity came across to me when someone from The
              Topps Company, Inc. an American company asked me to design them a
              modern version of their already existing card which was in
              production in 1986. They wanted the hand drawn version of the
              card. The image you are looking at on your left is that card.

            <h2>Very interesting story behind this artwork !</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
              So during 2021, when the whole world was under lockdown, Mrs Suzen
              from New York requested me to make a completely unique artwork
              where I was just presented with the 3 faces. So the story is that
              when the lockdown was announced and the flights were completely
              banned in America from any other country, Mrs Suzen’s husband was
              stuck in Cape town in Africa. She did not have any photo of them 3
              in a single photo. So for her daughter’s first birthday she wanted
              me to make a sketch where they 3 should be in a single pose. It
              was challenging to make a photo without any body reference but it
              was really a fun and learning experience to me.

          <div class="item-content">
            <h2>First time drawn a realistic sketch of a dog</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
              I got an opportunity where I was supposed to draw a dog’s realist
              portrait from a low resolution reference image. I learned a new
              technique where I learned to use a clay carving tool, which is
              used to make idols to make realistic looking fur of the dog. It
              was a great experience for me and I loved the whole process of
              making this sketch.
