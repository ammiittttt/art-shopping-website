        <h1>About me!</h1>
      <li>
        <h3>When did I start?</h3>
        <p>Story of my art journey began when my parents randomly encouraged me to participate in an art competition and came in first position. I was 7 years old and after that I started taking interest in art and painting.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Why do I love making pencil sketches?</h3>
        <p>I love making hyper realistic pencil sketches. I have tried almost every medium in art but I love graphite pencils to make drawings. I feel much more comfortable adding  skin texture etc. details in the sketch using graphite pencils than any other medium like watercolours and charcoal pencil. Nowadays I am learning digital drawing and I love it.
        </p>
